# Final Project CMPS 378 - Luxride

# Purpose of the app
The purpose of the app is to make sure users of ridehsare apps can give in depth reviews of drivers. This gives other users a better idea of how
well or badly others' experiences went compared to the existent 1-5 star rating system. Drivers can also make use of this app by registering so
they are able to see their own reviews they've recieved. Users can look up drivers to view relevant information on drivers (reviews).

# Execution
This app runs on VSCode.
